# repos_on_wiki

Jupyter-notebook featuring a simple analysis of links to institutional repositories (IR) on Wikipedia. Focus is on Germany, especially the [State and University Libraray Saxony-Anhalt](https://bibliothek.uni-halle.de/?lang=en).

## TL;DR

(German) national repositories are particularly present on German wikipedia and it seems as if IRs were generally referred to more frequently in the German wikipedia community. IRs of major universities in the English speaking world are found less often in English wikipedia. The [MENAdoc repository](https://www.menalib.de/en/vifa/menadoc/), which was at the centre of this quick research, is particularly present in German wikipedia.
